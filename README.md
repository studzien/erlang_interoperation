Erlang Interoperation Examples
==============================
This repository contains minimal examples of Erlang interoperating with
some external code.

All examples solve the same, example problem, a very simple integer
calculator supporting four operations:
- addition - ``add(X, Y)``
- subtraction - ``sub(X, Y)``
- multiplication - ``mul(X, Y)``
- integer division - ``div(X, Y)``

The directory names of the examples are trying to be self-explanatory.

Enter a specific directory to see the details regarding building and
running particular example.
